# Purple Tecnology Project 2015
## (Challenge for AIESEC internship)

In the word of Confucious
> The will to win, the desire to succeed, the urge to reach your full potential... these are the keys that will unlock the door to personal excellence.

### Overview
Create a simple REST API in Node.js with the below specific tasks.

### Tasks
1. Use CoffeeScript
2. Use Hapi.js framework
3. Create a route /exchange-rates/{base-currency} that returns the current exchange rate between the base currency and other currencies of the list: EUR, USD, GBP, CZK, JPY
4. Use Joi module to validate request and reponse 

### Bonus Tasks
1. Create a database of clients and their orders. You can use fixtures instead of an actual DB
2. Create route that will return all orders of a given customer. Customer is identified by e-mail.
3. Create a login route and a user DB
4. Make sure user can get only his orders, not orders of someone else
5. Create an admin user, that can get orders of any client

### Considerations
 To be successful you don't have to finish them all. Invest reasonable time depending on your free time and don't worry if you can't finish it all. Focus on quality of your code not on quantity of tasks. Make it readable, expandable and production ready.
